## Isomorphic Workshop

In this workshop, we are going to walk through the steps to create an Isomorphic application, compare it with a client-side rendering app (SPA) and try to figure out the best balance we should use for our apps.

The workshop is divided into different stages:

1. [Introduction: what is Isomorphic, Universal, server-side app and client-side app](https://slides.com/nanovazquez/workshop-isomorphic-apps/)
1. Exercise 0: Client-side app using React + Redux
1. Exercise 1: Server side rendering with React
1. Exercise 2: SEO
1. Exercise 3: Initial rendering time & bundle size
1. Bonus track: [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)

You can go through the different folders of each exercise, follow the step-by-step walkthrough in the *README.md* file or simply run the application.
