## Exercise 2: SEO

One of the benefits of Server-side rendering is the ability to render the entire HTML and sending it to the browser, allowing crawlers to get the entire set of information and thus increasing the ranking in the search engines and the visibility of your page. This entire process is named SEO (Search engine optimization).

If you are in such situation that you care about it, you should think about SSR. In this exercise, we will analyze 2 different sites and what type of information is collected in each one of them.

* next-react-app: https://next-react-app-puhrhetvhu.now.sh/

In this exercise, we will use [this tool](http://tools.seobook.com/general/spider-test/) to analyze both pages.

> **Note:** it is recommended that you use [fetch as google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6066468?hl=en) to analyze the SEO capabilities of your site, _just as google does_.
